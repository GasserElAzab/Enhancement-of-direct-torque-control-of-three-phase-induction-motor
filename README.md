# Enhancement-of-direct-torque-control-of-three-phase-induction-motor
The conventional direct torque control utilized a small PI control to compensate the difference between the required speed and the actual speed. 
Controlling torque load as well as the magentic flux ot the thre phase induction motor

In this project, the performance of direct torque control will be examined by the conventional way (PID) and two other controllers based on sliding mode control. The difference between the two controllers based on sliding mode control is only the change of the sliding surface, all of the simulations are done on Matlab/Simulink. 

you can check the full project report for more details and derivations, if you need further illustration, do not hesitate to contact me.
